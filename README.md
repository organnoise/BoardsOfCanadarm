BoardsOfCanadarm
================

These are the initial aspects of code to make Boards of Canadarm work using maxuino. 
I'm starting this project from scratch in terms of code now so that it works with Pure Data and handwritten Arduino Code.
These Max patches concepts on how to control the record player will still be used.
